It has been a while. Years. I haven't blogged, been on social media, or developed anything for years. So, I thought I would take it slow and start by throwing my self into all of it at the same time. 

Starting with (and taking it easy by) creating this blog as a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site. 

As a Chief Information Officer, I spend a lot of my time in meetings, reviewing/writing policies, and providing strategic direction to the overall IT department. I don't get a lot of time to code anything or get my hands dirty. In my spare time I used to make mobile games for Amazon, Alexa skills, and ruby applications as a hobby. I found that that was a great way to stay current with new technologies and keep my mind sharp.

I have missed operating in a text editor and diving in to troubleshoot wiring problems. It is time to pick it back up.
